Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the internship opportunity at Macquarie. As a Computer Science student at KL University with a 9.4 CGPA, I have a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and software development. I am passionate about solving real-world problems through technology. My skills include Java, Python, and C, along with web development experience in Flask and Streamlit.
My project experience demonstrates my ability to apply technical knowledge to create practical solutions. I developed a food image classifier using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and integrated the USDA Nutrition API to fetch real-time nutrient data. In another project, a football match analysis system, I used YOLO object detection to track players and the football and implemented K-means clustering to assign players to teams. I also have experience with CI/CD Pipelines and AWS. Additionally, I won the Impact Hackathon 2025 for building a financial dashboard for small businesses.
I am confident that my technical skills and passion for problem-solving would allow me to make a meaningful contribution to your team. I am eager to learn from the experts at Macquarie and apply my knowledge in a professional setting. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Amitav Godishala
